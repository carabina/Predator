1. Click [here](https://github.com/vpeschenkov/Predator/releases/download/1.0.2/Predator.saver.zip) to download the latest release
2. Open **Predator.saver** (double click)

4. Open `Preferences`
5. Select `Security & Privacy`
6. Select `General`

**Important**: If you haven't quit System Preferences before installation and were upgrading from a previous version, I strongly recommend you quit the application after installation, then reopen it, as updated Swift screensavers aren't loaded correctly in an active System Preferences session.
